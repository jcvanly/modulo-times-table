This is a modulo times table project by Jack Vanlyssel. This project requires no command line arguments, you simply launch the program in order to use it. Once launched you can use three buttons, two sliders, and 2 text boxes. For buttons, Start will begin the simulation, pause will pause the simulation and reset will pause the simulation and set it to function with the times table number and number of points specified by the user. you can also change the speed of the simulation or the increment of the times table using the two sliders. Github is really confusing to me so if there are any mistakes or problems please reach out to me at jvanlyssel@unm.edu.
